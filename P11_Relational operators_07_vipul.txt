int a,b,c;
printf("enter the value of a & b:");
scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
if(a>b)
printf("%d is greater than %d\n",a,b);
else if(a<b)
printf("%d is lesser than %d\n",a,b);
if (a>=b)
printf("%d is greater than or equal to %d\n",a,b);
else if(a<=b)
printf("%d is less than or equal to %d\n",a,b);
if(a==b)
printf("%d is equal to %d\n",a,b);
else if(a!=b)
printf("%d is not equal to %d\n",a,b);
    return 0;
