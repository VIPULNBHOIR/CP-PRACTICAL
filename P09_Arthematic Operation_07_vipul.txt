CODE:

// Analysis Increament & Decreament
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
int a,b;
float c;
a=5;b=2;
c=a+b;
printf("the sum of %d & %d is %f\n",a,b,c);
c=a*b;
printf("the Multiplication of %d & %d is %f\n",a,b,c); 
c=a/b;
printf("Integer division of %d & %d is %f\n",a,b,c); 
c=(float)a/b;
printf("Real division of %d & %d is %f\n",a,b,c);

return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
The sum of 5 & 2 is 7.000000
The Multiplication of 5 & 2 is 10.000000
Integer division of 5 & 2 is 2.000000
Real division of 5 & 2 is 2.500000
