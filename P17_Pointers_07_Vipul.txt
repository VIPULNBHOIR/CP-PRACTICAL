#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
    long int num = 10;
    long int *ptr;
    printf("num's address: %p\n", &num);
    ptr = &num;
    
    printf("pointer's adress: %p\n", &ptr);
    
    printf("pointer's size: %ld bytes\n", sizeof(ptr));
    
    printf("pointer's value: %p\n", ptr);
    
    printf("value pointed to: %ld\n", *ptr);
    
}




OUTPUT:
num's address: 0x7ffc4aaf7358
pointer's adress: 0x7ffc4aaf7360
pointer's size: 8 bytes
pointer's value: 0x7ffc4aaf7358
value pointed to: 10
